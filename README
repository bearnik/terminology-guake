This is an EFL terminal emulator with some extra bells and whistles.
It's brand new and was only started near the begining of June 2012, so
expecting it to do everything a mature terminal emulator does is a bit
premature, but considering it's young age, it does a lot.

Compiling:
----------

Once you have met requirements, compiling and installing is simple:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

Note: to make terminology work with input methods in general you need:

export ECORE_IMF_MODULE="xim"
export XMODIFIERS="@im=none"

Special key controls:

Shift+PgUp = Scroll 1 page up
Shift+PgDn = Scroll 1 page down
Shift+Insert = Paste Clipboard (ctrl+v/c) selection
Shift+Ctrl+Insert = Paste Primary (hilight) selection
Shift+Keypad-Plus = Font size up 1
Shift+Keypad-Minus = Font size down 1
Shift+Keypad-Multiply = Reset font size to 10
Shift+Keypad-Divide = Copy highlight to Clipboard (same as ctrl+c in gui apps)
Alt+Home = Enter command mode (enter commands to control terminology itself)

Command mode commands currently understood:

f = Reset font to default settign saved in config
f+ = Increase fontsize
f- = Decreate fontsize
fb = Display big font size (10x20 bitmap, or size 20 with scalable).
gNxM = make terminal NxM chars in size (if possible). e.g. g80x48 g40x20.
       If just one number is provided, it will use the following shortcuts:

       g7=120x80; g8=120x120
b = reset the background (no media)

Mouse controls:

Right mouse button = controls menu
Middle mouse button = paste highlight selection
Left mouse button/drag = make highlight

  2.   { char
  3... sequence of UTF8 chars other than nul (\000 or 0x00).
