*E17 Terminology terminal emulator with guake functionality*

This is just a test project. Hopefully they will make that integration in original Terminology, but I just can't wait. :)

TODO :

 - New menu in Options
 	- Bind : binding F12 key and toggle show/hide for console
	- Expand : press F12 twice for maximize and then hide the console
 - Make above work

To compile and install for now just do:

**Dependencies: a lot -.- **

<pre>
$./autoget.sh --prefix=/home/someuser/testdir

$ make
$ make install 

</pre>

To uninstal just make 
<pre>
$ make uninstall
</pre>
